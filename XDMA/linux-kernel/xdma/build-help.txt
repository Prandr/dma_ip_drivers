XDMA driver build options for make use following naming convention:
Compile-only options are all capitalised (like a define would be), while 
options that are also availible as module options (that can be passed to
modprobe while inserting the driver) are in lowercase to keep them consistent.

DEBUG=1
Enable verbose debug messages. Could potentially overflow dmesg.

POLLING=1
Enable polling mode instead of interrupts

PREFIX=[name]
Allows to change the prefix of the device files from "xdma" 
(which remains default) to one that describes actual function of underlying
device, like "dsp_processor".

HIEARARCHICAL=1
This will character put devices into /dev/<prefix>/<device_num>/ for better
overview thus putting them into hierarchy. Particularly useful in case of
multiple physical devices on the same host. Default is old naming convention
to keep backward compatibility.

VENDOR_ID=[num], DEVICE_ID=[num]
The options allow to set custom PCI vendor and device IDs and must be used
together to have an effect. 0x10ee, 0x8034, which are default IP Core values
are still recognized, but only for development, testing and prototyping 
purposes. 

config_bar_num=[num]
Tell the driver which BAR is used by the XDMA. Default is autodetection by
probing the BARs, which is performed only when 2 BARs are active. 
In this case may be necessary, if your FPGA design/device cannot tolerate 
probing by the driver.

h2c_timeout=[x]
Timeout in ms for H2C DMA interfaces. Default is 5 s.
0 causes ~50 day timeout in interrupt mode and indefinite wait in polling mode.


c2h_timeout=[x]
Timeout in ms for C2H DMA interfaces. Default is 5 s.
0 causes ~50 day timeout in interrupt mode and indefinite wait in polling mode.

c2h_credits=[x]
Enable credits for C2H DMA interfaces. Which set x credits for each transfer.
Haphazardly implemented and untested.
More a provision than a real feature.
