XDMA driver build options for make use following naming convention:
Compile-only options are all capitalised (like a define would be), while 
options that are also availible as module options (that can be passed to
modprobe while inserting the driver) are in lowercase to keep them consistent.

DEBUG=1
Enable verbose debug messages. Could potentially overflow dmesg.

POLLING=1
Enable polling mode instead of interrupts

config_bar_num=[num]
Tell the driver which BAR is used by the XDMA. Default is autodetection by
probing the BARs, which is performed only when 2 BARs are active. 
In this case may be necessary, if your FPGA design/device cannot tolerate 
probing by the driver.

h2c_timeout=[x]
Timeout in ms for H2C DMA interfaces. Default is 5 s.
0 causes ~50 day timeout in interrupt mode and indefinite wait in polling mode.


c2h_timeout=[x]
Timeout in ms for C2H DMA interfaces. Default is 5 s.
0 causes ~50 day timeout in interrupt mode and indefinite wait in polling mode.

c2h_credits=[x]
Enable credits for C2H DMA interfaces. Which set x credits for each transfer.
Haphazardly implemented and untested.
More a provision than a real feature.
